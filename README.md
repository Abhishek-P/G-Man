# G-Sys
**G**eographical Crop and Agricultural Management **Sys**tem

The goal of the project is to allow for a map based software for management of agricultural processes and crop. 

The first milestone is to model different entities. 
The primary mode of management will be for Coffee Plantations but hopefully the model will be flexible enough, so it can be expanded to other modes.
